# Project Description:
The goal of this project is to identify patterns in historical video game sales data to understand the factors that drive a game's success. With this information, it will be possible to predict which games are likely to succeed in the future and plan more targeted advertising campaigns. The 2016 data will be used to make forecasts for 2017, focusing on understanding which game attributes, such as genre, reviews, and other factors, directly impact sales. This will help in making data-driven decisions and optimizing marketing strategies.

The *games_sales.ipynb* notebook contains the complete code for designing data visualizations and conducting further analyses.

## Relevant results
**Key Time Periods:**
- Significant increase in the number of games released begins in 2002.
- 2005 marks the start of a relevant period for modeling data toward 2017, with platforms still active in 2015 emerging during this time.
  
**Platform Popularity:**
- In 2002, top 5 platforms: PS2, X360, Wii, PS3, and DS.
- By 2005, platforms still relevant in 2015 are emerging, and the order of popularity shifts: X360, Wii, PS3, DS, and PS2. Meaning PS2's popularity peaks earlier.

**Projected Relevance for 2017:**
- Game lifetime data suggests a 10-year lifecycle.
- Based on that, analysis of top 10 best-selling games suggests PS4 will remain relevant in 2017.
  
**Correlation Analysis:**
- Positive correlation observed between critic scores and total sales for Wii, PS2, and PS4, indicating that higher critic scores positively influence total sales.
- A weaker positive correlation observed between user ratings and total sales for Wii, PS2, with an almost null correlation for PS4.

**Platform Genre Investment and Sales:**
- Platforms focusing on action, sports, and shooter genres tend to have higher total sales compared to others.
