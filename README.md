# Video Game Sales Analysis
The *games_sales.ipynb* notebook provided above contains the complete code for data cleaning and wrangling, creating visualizations, and conducting further analyses.

### What was done:
Historical video game sales data was analyzed to identify patterns and understand the factors influencing a game's commercial success. The dataset from 2016 was used to build forecasts for 2017. The analysis included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and visualizations.

### Objective:
To determine which game attributes (e.g., genre, platform, review scores) most significantly affect sales, enabling predictions of future hits and more effective, data-driven marketing strategies.

### Results:
- Impact of Reviews on Sales: Critic scores show a strong positive correlation with total sales across Wii, PS2, and PS4, while user scores are less predictive
- Genre Influence on Revenue: Action, sports, and shooter genres consistently generate higher sales.
- Platform and Lifecycle Trends: Analysis of historical data revealed shifts in platform popularity over time, with PS2 peaking earlier and PS4 expected to remain relevant in 2017, reflecting typical 10-year game lifecycles.

### Tools & Languages Used:
- Languages: Python
- Workspace: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and  scipy.stats

### Possible Improvements & Next Steps:

- Incorporate machine learning models for sales prediction.
- Include additional data sources like regional trends, or social media sentiment.
- Extend analysis to post-2017 data for validation and refinement of predictive models.
- Explore genre popularity trends by region to better target campaigns.
