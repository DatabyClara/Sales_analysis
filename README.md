# Project Description:
The goal of this project is to identify patterns in historical video game sales data to understand the factors that drive a game's success. With this information, it will be possible to predict which games are likely to succeed in the future and plan more targeted advertising campaigns. The 2016 data will be used to make forecasts for 2017, focusing on understanding which game attributes, such as genre, reviews, and other factors, directly impact sales. This will help in making data-driven decisions and optimizing marketing strategies.

The *games_sales.ipynb* notebook contains the complete code for designing data visualizations and conducting further analyses.

**Projected Relevance for 2017:**
- Game lifetime data suggests a 10-year lifecycle.
- Based on that, analysis of top 10 best-selling games suggests PS4 will remain relevant in 2017.
  
**Correlation Analysis:**
- Positive correlation observed between critic scores and total sales for Wii, PS2, and PS4, indicating that higher critic scores positively influence total sales.
- A weaker positive correlation observed between user ratings and total sales for Wii, PS2, with an almost null correlation for PS4.
