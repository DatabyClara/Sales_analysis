# Video Game Sales Analysis
The *games_sales.ipynb* notebook provided above contains the complete code for data cleaning and wrangling, creating visualizations, and conducting further analyses.

### What was done:
Historical video game sales data was analyzed to identify patterns and understand the factors influencing a game's commercial success. The dataset from 2016 was used to build forecasts for 2017. The analysis included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, correlation studies, and visualizations.

### Objective:
To determine which game attributes (e.g., genre, platform, review scores) most significantly affect sales, enabling predictions of future hits and more effective, data-driven marketing strategies.

### Results:
- Key Time Periods: A noticeable increase in game releases starts in 2002. 2005 marks the emergence of platforms still active in 2015, making it a useful starting point for forecasting 2017 trends.
- Platform Popularity: In 2002, the top platforms were PS2, X360, Wii, PS3, and DS. By 2015, the order shifted, indicating changing platform dominance and the decline of PS2.
- Projected 2017 Relevance: Game life cycles average around 10 years. PS4, being among the top platforms in 2016, is expected to remain relevant in 2017.

### Correlation Analysis:
- Critic scores show a strong positive correlation with total sales for Wii, PS2, and PS4.
- User scores show a weaker or negligible correlation, especially on PS4.
- Genre Influence on Sales: Action, sports, and shooter games consistently generate higher sales across top platforms.

### Tools & Languages Used:
- Languages: Python
- Workspace: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and  scipy.stats

### Possible Improvements & Next Steps:

- Incorporate machine learning models for sales prediction.
- Include additional data sources like regional trends, or social media sentiment.
- Extend analysis to post-2017 data for validation and refinement of predictive models.
- Explore genre popularity trends by region to better target campaigns.
